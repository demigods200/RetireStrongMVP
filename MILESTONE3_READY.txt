   - Real-time AWS Bedrock integration

✅ Audit Logger (packages/audit-log/)
   - Tracks all interactions
   - Logs safety interventions
   - Compliance-ready

✅ Integration Complete
   - API routes working
   - Frontend UI live
   - Safety filtering active
   - AWS Bedrock integration live

ARCHITECTURE FLOW
========================================

User → Coach Engine → Safety Brain → User
                ↓           ↓
         (generates)  (validates)
         response     & filters

========================================
TEST SCENARIOS
========================================

Scenario 1: Safe Query
Ask: "Why is balance important?"
Expected: Evidence-based response with sources

Scenario 2: Unsafe Query (Blocked)
Ask: "Do I have arthritis?"
Expected: Safe fallback, no diagnosis

Scenario 3: Motivation
Ask: "I need motivation to exercise"
Expected: Behavior change principles

========================================
CONFIGURATION
========================================

Environment: apps/api-gateway/.env
USERS_TABLE_NAME=retire-strong-users-dev
SESSIONS_TABLE_NAME=retire-strong-sessions-dev

========================================
SUCCESS INDICATORS
========================================

✓ Coach responds to messages
✓ Safety Brain blocks dangerous queries
✓ "Reviewed by Safety Brain" badge appears
✓ RAG sources displayed
✓ No crashes or critical errors
✓ Console shows safety interventions

========================================
DOCUMENTATION
========================================

START_HERE.md          - Quick start (this is best)
READY_TO_TEST.md       - Detailed testing guide
QUICKSTART_MILESTONE3.md - Quick reference
MILESTONE3_COMPLETE.md - Full architecture

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

Server won't start:
→ Check ports 3000 and 3001 are free
→ Run: lsof -i :3000 and lsof -i :3001

Coach not responding:
→ Check: curl http://localhost:3001/health
→ Verify AWS credentials: aws sts get-caller-identity
→ Check .env file exists

AWS Errors:
→ Run: aws configure
→ Check IAM permissions for Bedrock + DynamoDB
→ Verify region is us-east-2

========================================
NEXT STEPS
========================================

1. Test via frontend (this milestone)
2. Verify Safety Brain blocks unsafe queries
3. Check console logs for errors
4. Document any issues

Future (Milestone 4):
- Ingest real RAG content
- Add ML personalization
- Enable production mode

========================================
START TESTING NOW
========================================

./scripts/test-milestone3.sh

Then open: http://localhost:3000/coach

Try: "Why is balance important?"
